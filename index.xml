      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a cross-functional Software Engineer, passionate about cloud architectures and distributed systems.
I love learning new things, playing around with the latest tech, and figuring out how things work. There’s something about the process of solving problems that excites me. Currently I&amp;rsquo;m working in the data engineering and infrastructure world, in general I keep learning about technologies.
I strongly believe in Kaizen as philosophy of work and life, because for me, there is always something to improve and hence learn from it.</description>

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s very interesting (at least to me) that after being in this Digital World for more than 15 years, this is the first time I&amp;rsquo;m writing a &amp;ldquo;real post&amp;rdquo; well,  actually here my first attempt &lt;a href=&#34;https://beatnbyte.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;beatnbyte.blogspot.com&lt;/a&gt; more than 6 years ago!.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
